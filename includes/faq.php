                                    <p>It is rather a convention that is being followed by landowners to seal
                                        rental/lease agreements only for 11 months to avoid registration of the
                                        agreement with the local competent authorities. A rental agreement exceeding 11
                                        months in tenure should be mandatorily registered to make it executable under
                                        the Registration Act of India. To avoid these formalities, agreements are made
                                        for 11 months and extended as per mutual consensus of the parties involved.</p>
